# Todo Web App

A todo web app built with tech stack such as: Django, HTML, Bootstrap, and PostgresSQL.

In the course of development, I explored the object relational mapper (ORM), and django form, using a function based view with CRUD operations. The storage framework used are sqlite and PostgresSQL during development.

This is one of my hands-on experience with Django, CRUD operations, database development and Web hosting.
